Hi I'm Gunnarhawk, I am mainly interested in Web Development but enjoy doing just about anything from building games in unity to making discord bots for my servers

I have been programming for just over 8 years now. As of now, I mainly work in C#, JS, HTML, CSS. But I have experience in PHP, Java, Python, and Ruby.

You can reach me at **gunnarhawk2@gmail.com** or through my discord at **gunnarhawk**
